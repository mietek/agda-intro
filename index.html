<h1>Conor's Agda Course Materials</h1>

This is a dummy homepage, designed to stop nasty 403 errors from
appearing in your browser when you surf up the course darcs repo.
Your best bet is to download it, using
<blockquote><code>darcs get
http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/pub/dtp</code></blockquote>.

At the moment, the interesting file is <a
href="VecFin.lagda">VecFin.lagda</a>, but more and more interesting
files will emerge in due course, given that a course is due.
